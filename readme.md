Tasks solved during my training in Softuni.bg (https://softuni.bg)

Note:

- The tasks do not include Test class with test cases since they are inspected by the Judge system of SoftUni.

- Despite of the fact that i have graduated the SoftUni modules till Java OOP, the soft-uni repository is still not completed (not all tasks are upoloaded in github), because now i am solving the tasks again and uploading them in github.
