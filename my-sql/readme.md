Tasks from MySQL module

Notes:

- The task are grouped in folders which represent the different examined/learned topics during my training

- For some topics/lectures some or all tasks are groupped in a single .sql file since they are short SQL queries

-- The tasks from the lectures are named as "lecture-name-*lab*" and from the exercices are named "lecture-name-*exercise*"

- The tasks labelled with double hyphen (e.g. --task-name) are the most difficult tasks for the current topic/lecture
