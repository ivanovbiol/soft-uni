Tasks from MySQL module

Notes:

- Each examined/learned topic has it's own folder in which the different tasks are grouped in individual folders

- For some topics/lectures some or all tasks are groupped in a single .sql file since they are short SQL queries

- The tasks from the lectures and exercices are named as "lecture-name-**lab**" or "exercise-name-**exercise**"

- The tasks labelled with double hyphen (e.g. --task-name) are the most difficult tasks for the current topic/lecture
