Tasks from Java Advanced module

Notes:

- The task are grouped in folders which represent the different examined/learned topics during my training

- The tasks from Java Advanced module will be solved only in one Main class with additional private methods

- For each topic/lecture the tasks starting with double hyphen (e.g. --task-name) are the most difficult tasks for the current topic/lecture
